# Very Basic Hello World Program

A simple program that does nothing and simply prints different things on Windows/Linux.

To build, simply run the script corresponding to your OS under [`scripts`](/scripts/).

**NOTE:** You'll need [`Clang`](https://releases.llvm.org/12.0.0/tools/clang/docs/index.html) installed and present in the path.
